### Translation notes

Let's start with the title. Many translators go for 'farewell'. I feel like 'farewell' is a boring title that misses the point -  there's something more here that justifies this being called a send-off.<br>

The meaning of this poem is in the phrase *bai yun* 白雲 ('white clouds'). White clouds are free and transitory, and this idea can be metaphorically applied to the state of mind of the subject of the poem. The traveller has chosen a transitory life having felt previously unfulfilled, and we know that Wang Wei has led a similarly free-spirited life. The representation through the white clouds of a free and transitory life in every direction signifies a meaningful moment of understanding shared between two souls on their own paths.<br>

Another reference in the poem is the idea of retreating to seclusion in the southern mountains. This echoes *Drinking Wine No. 5* by Tao Yuanming 陶渊明, one of the *Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove*. More on him soon...
