            "content_text": "The fifth translation in this endeavour, and our second poem by Wang Wei about the colour of moss. I discovered this poem a few weeks ago when reading through an anthology of Wang Wei’s works, and it has been lodged in the back of my mind ever since. It is a vivid and visual delight.\n\n\n\n\n  書事\n\n\n\n  輕陰閣小雨，\n深院晝慵開。\n坐看蒼苔色，\n欲上人衣來。 \n\n\n\n  Writing On A Happening\n\n\n\n\n  A faint shade stopped the drizzle \ndeep in courtyard daylight yet \ntoo lazy to open the gate \nI sat watching the green moss’ greenness \nas if it were climbing my robe \n\n\nTranslation notes\n\nThe title of this poem is important, because it implies an event (or series of events) so notable had occurred that Wang Wei had to record it in detail.\n\nGe 閣 in the first line means to stop. It’s that the poem is being written from the subjective and imaginative perspective of the poet: the coming of shade doesn’t cause rain to stop, but as he perceived the scene, it did. It almost lends this faint shade a magical or supernatural power.\n\nThe second line is where this poem starts to reveal its character, and where I think two lines are required in English to convey the original one line in Chinese. Shen 深 is usually translated as ‘deep’ - in Deer Place this character was used to describe the ‘deep forest’. Yuan 院 means ‘courtyard’, and zhou 晝 is usually translated as ‘daytime’. So, one might be tempted to take these three characters at face value, and translate the beginning of the second line as ‘deep in the courtyard during daytime’.\n\nHowever, shen 深 is occasionally used to describe deep, vivid, saturated hues. If we remember the faintness of the shade alluded to in the line above, the challenge is to continue the theme of light and colour (this comes in useful later), while also getting across the time of day. Therefore, ‘deep in courtyard daylight’.\n\nThe time of day is important because the next two characters don’t give us much. Yong 慵 means lazy and kai 開 means open. The gate to the courtyard is implied, and the laziness is further implied because it’s already daytime (as signified by zhou 晝, mentioned above) and the gate is still closed. As well as being connected to the character shen 深 (‘deep’), I felt zhou 晝 (‘daylight’) also needed to be connected to yong 慵 (‘laziness’) though a word such as ‘yet’ or ‘but’. Having extracted all the meaning we possibly can from the second line, we are set up for a beautiful conclusion.\n\nCang 蒼 is a shade of deep green, and refers to tai 苔 (‘moss’, also featured in Deer Place. But Wang Wei doesn’t stop there. After these two characters he also adds the character se 色, which means colour. This makes the colour of the moss, rather than the moss itself, the subject of this line. Some translators might use a literal word such as ‘colour’ here. But what is the poet really writing about? In a poem where each character conveys multiple meanings, here we have two characters intentionally emphasising one concept: the colour of the moss. I have chosen to use the ‘greenness’ of the green moss to playfully double up in the same way that the characters do, while also emphasising what I believe the poet imagined: a colour so vivid, a hue that permeated him so deeply, that he felt like the moss was climbing his robe.\n",

The genre of shanshui 山水 (landscape, literally ‘mountain water’) poetry and art is what first drew me to Chinese history and culture. Almost two thousand years ago, between his numerous campaigns to unify Northern China and conquer neighbouring warlords, Cao Cao wrote the following:\n\n\n  觀滄海 \n\n\n\n  東臨碣石，以觀滄海。 \n水何澹澹，山島竦峙。 \n樹木叢生，百草豐茂。 \n秋風蕭瑟，洪波湧起。 \n日月之行，若出其中； \n星漢燦爛，若出其里。 \n幸甚至哉，歌以詠志。 \n\n\n\n  Behold The Deep Blue Sea \n\n\n\n  I headed east for Jieshi mountain, to behold the deep blue sea. \nHow rough and roiling the tide! Mountainous islands stand tall. \nThickets of trees thriving with life, a hundred plants flourish in bloom. \nAutumn winds rustle and howl, vast waves gush forth. \nThe path of the sun and moon, as if emerging from the middle of it; \nStars shine and sparkle resplendent, as if born from within it. \nSuch a great fortune to behold! Let these words become a poem of remembrance. \n\n\nTranslation notes\n\nAnother poem with a title that immediately poses an imponderable question to a Western reader: what is the colour of the sea? Cang 滄 is really the colour of the sea, somewhere between grey and blue. Here, I have chosen ‘deep blue’ to add depth to the colour, and the sea itself. \n\nThe other tricky word in the title is guan 觀 (to watch). This was also in the title of the previous poem, ‘Contemplating a Game of Weiqi’. In that poem, Su Shi was listening to a game of weiqi and writing a poem based on what he imagined. So, translating the word as watching instead of contemplating would have been inaccurate. Here, Cao Cao is also not simply watching something. He headed east to Jieshi mountain ‘in order to’ (a rough translation of yi 以) watch the sea. So, he’s watching the sea from a vantage point, and contemplating the origin of the sun, moon and stars. Sounds more like ‘beholding’ to me. \n\nRemember, Cao Cao was a warlord. Many translations of this poem focus on some peace found within nature. Rather, I read his respect for the ferocity and power of nature. Where there are ambiguous characters such as dan 澹 (tranquil, but can also be translated as rough when referring to the sea), I have elected to represent the full force of the scene.\n",

This was the first Chinese poem to really capture my attention. Much of Wang Wei’s writing is imbued with Buddhist themes. This poem is one of his most famous, and therefore one of his most translated. However, almost all translations focus only on the first stanza. The elusive second stanza hasn’t quite made it into popular culture, but I feel it adds much more meaning.\n\n \n\n鹿柴\n\n\n\n空山不見人，\n\n但聞人語響。\n\n返景入深林，\n\n復照青苔上。\n\n\n\n日夕見寒山，\n\n便為獨往客。\n\n不知深林事，\n\n但有麇麚跡。\n\n\n\nDeer Place\n\n\n\nAt the wild mountain I see no people\n\nbut hear echoes of human voices\n\nlight returning enters the deep forest\n\nonce more illuminating green moss above\n\n\n\nIn evening glow I watch the cold mountain\n\nat the moment a lone traveller appears\n\nI don’t know the ways of the deep forest\n\nonly the tracks left by the water deer\n\n\n\nTranslation Notes\n\nThe first characters presented to us pose some fun challenges. First, the title, Luzhai 鹿柴, is understood to be the name of a place close to where the poet lived. The second character is often translated as enclosure, or the title is often translated as Deer Park but I have chosen to convey the meaning of a place where deer are.\n\nThe first characters of the poem itself kongshan 空山 literally mean ‘empty mountain’. We can already get quite deep here, and try to reflect the poet’s focus on emptiness rather than the mountain itself. However, to Western eyes I think the idea of wilderness is more easily conveyed. A place where the poet is alone, which may already imply more spiritual ideas.\n\nThe first stanza is a joy to translate, so much so that an entire book has been written about the different approaches that can be taken. The poem can be read as taking place between two realms: the human realm which manifests itself more clearly as the poem goes on, and the spiritual realm represented by the elusive deer and depictions of the natural world.\n\nSome translators take this idea further in the first stanza, by interpreting the character fan 返 as referring to an indirect light source. Therefore, rather than the light returning after a period of absence, the light itself is being reflected from another object not mentioned (we might imagine from the leaves of a tree) and this indirect light source illuminates the green moss. This dual meaning is tough to translate in poetic form, but the phrase ‘light returning’ is suitable because the light has something modifying it with this phrasing.\n",
