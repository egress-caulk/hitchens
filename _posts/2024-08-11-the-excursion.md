### Translation notes

There are some mind-boggling translation challenges in this poem. However, one character in this poem has been notorious for decades. *Cui* 翠 is the Chinese word for kingfisher. However, in our poem it refers to the colour of eyebrows. Indeed, some [published translations](https://poets.org/poem/excursion) of this poem (which I am indebted to for finding a short and creative poem title to use in blog posts) simply translate this phrase as ‘kingfisher eyebrows’. Orientalism alert! I won’t link to it, but I think this type of (mis-)translation has directly led to one art gallery online stating: 

> It is likely no surprise that the kingfisher is a symbol of beauty, and in China apparently it is a compliment for women to have “kingfisher eyebrows”.

A translation in a book of Du Fu’s poetry has ‘azure kohl’ (I then had to look up ‘kohl’ - it’s a type of chemical used in old Chinese make-up). Another word that appears in my dictionary is ‘alcedine’ (which I also had to look up, apparently it is derived from the Latin word for kingfisher).

As Professor Stephen Owen at Harvard wrote in a [riposte](https://doi.org/10.2307/823510) to Professor Paul W. Kroll at Colorado Boulder on this subject:

> It is time for someone to present the counter-argument - why “azure” can be a better translation for *cui* 翠 than “halcyon”... <br> <br>
> Implicit in Kroll's comments is a belief... that words refer directly to some clearly defineable entity or event, and that translation consists of finding the corresponding word in another language. Erudition means having a full store of such correspondences, and the failure to use the "correct" corresponding word will seem shockingly imprecise. This view of language is adequate for acts of naming: "What kind of bird is that?" - “It's a *cui*.” - "We call it a halcyon kingfisher.”<br> <br>
> *Cui* is a halycon kingfisher; it is also one of the more common “poetic” words to describe the color of vegetation. Its use as a color is in fact so common that the seme ”bird” recedes into the background [‘seme’ is short for semanteme: a linguistic term meaning ‘a minimal distinctive unit of meaning’]. If we speak of the “emerald sea” in an English poem, the dominant seme is a quality of color and not a stone."

Here, I agree with Professor Owen on the nature of translation. Du Fu is not referring to kingfishers here, because there isn’t anything obviously kingfisher-like that can be applied to eyebrows. Du Fu is rather referring to a quality associated with kingfishers. However, I don’t agree that ‘azure’ is an appropriate translation. Rather, a guy called Matt runs a [blog](http://no-sword.jp/blog/2013/07/alcedine.html) called no-sword where he references a piece that Professor Peter A. Boodberg wrote in the 1950s on chromatonyms, or words that describe colours:

> The rich spectrum of Chinese chromatonymy, multilined and multibanded, has not received the attention it deserves. Most chromatonyms are not too well defined in our dictionaries, and translation equivalents are chosen haphazardly according to context, with little consideration paid to semantic nuances. Among the many Chinese color-terms crying for simple and effective rendering is the adjective *cui*, 'vivid green-blue-purple-black', originally descriptive of the glossy iridescent plumage of the kingfisher... 'Kingfisher-green' (-blue, -black, -brown) is an awkward polysyllabic way to translate *cui* which may describe women's penciled eyebrows as well as foliage... <br><br>
> Is there any reason why we should not use the term alcedine (from Latin *alcedo*, 'kingfisher') to designate exactly what *cui* connotated to the Chinese? Alcedine is a handsomely tailored word, sonorous and precise, yet broad enough to be safely applicable as a color-epithet to a variety of things.

So, here lies the origin story of the word ‘alcedine’. But within this description, we have a word that I think works as the an even better translation: ‘iridescent’. It doesn’t matter what the colour is, what matters is that it is a beautiful kingfisher-like quality of a colour, or combination of colours, that we can’t easily reach for in English.

This isn’t the only dazzling description of beauty in the poem. In the first verse, the English ‘slice’ in my translation doesn’t exist in the original description of lotus roots, where the ladies are performing an action that seems to turn the snow-white lotus roots into strands of silk. It’s beyond my ability to accurately condense this idea into three or four words.

Finally, in case you were wondering about the motives of Du Fu and his pals, my dictionary was very keen to tell me that 妓 *ji* (translated to ‘courtesans’ in the title) gives other translations such as ‘artiste, performer, geisha...’ before stating ‘NOT a prostitute’ (no emphasis added by me).
