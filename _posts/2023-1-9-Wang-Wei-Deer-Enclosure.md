>Let's start from the beginning shall we? Not from the beginning of Chinese recorded history, rather my own experience with old Chinese poems. This was the first Chinese poem to really capture my attention.

<br>

There are people far more qualified than I who can tell you about Wang Wei 王維 (699 - 759). He was a minor official who was famous, even in his own time, for his writing. And, much of his writing was imbued with Buddhist themes.

<br>

This poem is one of his most famous, and therefore one of his most translated. However, almost all translations focus only on the first stanza. The elusive second stanza hasn't quite made it into popular culture, but I feel it adds much more meaning.

<br>
  
  **鹿柴** 
  
  <br>
    
  空山不見人，
  
  但聞人語響。
	
  返景入深林，
  
  復照青苔上。
  
  <br>
  
  日夕見寒山，
	
  便為獨往客。
	
  不知深林事，

  但有麇麚跡。
  
  <br><br>
  
  **Deer Place** 
  
  <br>
  
  At the wild mountain I see no people
  
  but hear echoes of human voices
  
  light returning enters the deep forest
  
  once more illuminating green moss
    
  <br>
  
  In evening glow I watch the cold mountain
  
  at the moment a lone traveller appears
  
  I don’t know the ways of the deep forest
  
  only the tracks left by the water deer
  
  <br><br>
