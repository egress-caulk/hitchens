Xie Lingyun 謝靈運 (385 - 483) is widely considered to be one of the first Chinese landscape poets, and blended themes of early Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian thought into his poetry. Born into a noble family, Xie suffered from a string of demotions and ended up living in exile, where he wrote about the wild Southern landscape.
