During the Song dynasty (960 - 1279) it was fashionable to think of Meng Haoran 孟浩然 (689 - 740) and [Wang Wei](/poets/wang-wei.html) 王維 (699 - 759) as belonging to the same school of poetry. They both wrote naturalistic poems conveyed with clarity and simplicity. Together with Li Bai 李白 (701 - 762) and Du Fu 杜甫 (712 – 770), these four poets are considered to be the greatest poets of the Tang dynasty.
