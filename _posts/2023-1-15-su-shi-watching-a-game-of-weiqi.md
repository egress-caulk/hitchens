<br>

Here one of the most accomplished figures in classical Chinese literature, Su Shi 蘇軾 (1037 - 1101) takes us on a journey to watch white cranes and overhears a game of *weiqi*, the Chinese name for Go, the ancient board game. One of my favourite couplets comes at the end of this poem, a vivid imagining of living the good life.
  
<br>
  
>**观棋**

  
>予素不解棋，尝独游庐山白鹤观，观中人皆阖户昼寝，独闻棋声于古松流水之间，意欣然喜之，自尔欲学，然终不解也。儿子过乃粗能者，儋守张中日从之戏，予亦隅坐，竟日不以为厌也。
  
>五老峰前，白鹤遗址。<br>
>长松荫庭，风日清美。<br>
>我时独游，不逢一士。<br>
>谁欤棋者，户外屦二。<br>
>不闻人声，时闻落子。<br>
>纹枰坐对，谁究此味。<br>
>空钩意钓，岂在鲂鲤。<br>
>小儿近道，剥啄信指。<br>
>胜固欣然，败亦可喜。<br>
>优哉游哉，聊复尔耳。<br> <br>

>**Contemplating A Game of Weiqi**
<br>      
>I'm a simple person and don't understand the game of *weiqi*. I once travelled alone to the Lu mountains to see white cranes. Everyone who goes to watch the cranes tends to nap during the day behind closed doors. I could only hear the sound of *weiqi* stones amid the old pine trees and flowing water. I rejoiced at the thought and took delight in it. That which I wanted to learn, I never ultimately understood. 
    
>After my son passed away I made an effort to learn *weiqi*, in order to take the responsibility to preserve a game followed by many in the Middle Kingdom and Japan. I found a nook to sit in, but the whole day I didn't find any satisfaction.
    
>In front of *Wulao* peak, a place vacated by white cranes. <br>
>Tall pines shade the courtyard, beautiful sunlight and a cool breeze. <br>
>When I was travelling alone, I didn't meet a soul. <br>
>But who are these players? By the door two straw sandals. <br>
>No voice to be heard, the occasional sound of falling stones. <br>
>Sat opposite the patterned board, who can comprehend the essence of this scene? <br>
>When fishing with an empty hook, does one really expect to land bream and carp? <br>
>A small boy is close to the Way of things, placing stones and trusting his fingers. <br>
>To win is certainly pleasurable, even defeat can be joyful. <br>
>Drifting along unhurried and easy! For a while like this and nothing more.<br> <br>

Translation notes

<br>

There are a few tricky phrases, particularly in the preamble. It took me a while to figure out that *guo* 过 (to pass) in this context must be a euphemism for his son passing away, much like the English usage of the word.<br>

The real action comes in the last line, with two phrases so famous that they have both entered the dictionary. However, as their usage has become more common, the dictionary definition doesn't quite do justice to their poetic impact. The character *zai* 哉 is an exclamation, and here we see it recur twice. So, a huge amount of emphasis is being placed on this feeling of being leisurely and carefree. Finally, in case any Chinese nerds are interested in how I arrived at my translation, we have *liao* 聊 (for a while) *fu* 复 (a conjunction) *er* 尔 ('like this' similar in meaning to *ran* 然), and *er* 耳 (*eryi* 而已 in Modern Chinese, 'and nothing else').
