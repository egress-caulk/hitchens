This poem by Meng Haoran may have once been the most famous poem in China: it was one of the first poems that generations of educated Chinese children would memorise owing to its place on the first page of the *Qianjia Shi* 千家詩 (A Thousand Family Poems) anthology. Evidenced by many of his other poems, Meng Haoran liked to drink. This poem was written after a sleepless night, but I also like to imagine him slightly hungover.

>**春曉‌**

  

>春眠不覺曉，<br>
>處處聞啼鳥。<br>
>夜來風雨聲，<br>
>花落知多少。<br> <br>

>**Spring Dawn**
<br>      
    
>Springtime, half-asleep, unaware of daybreak, <br>
>All around I hear birdsong. <br>
>Night brought noise, wind and rain, <br>
>Blossoms fell, who knows how many? <br><br>

##### Translation notes

Although the characters are quite easy to understand in this poem, a translation isn't quite so straightforward.  It's a challenge to translate each character in an order that is faithful to the original, so some poetic licence is required. Imagining the poet half-awake and articulating one thought after another helped me retain as much of the original structure as possible, the only major deviation is the character *sheng* 聲 (noise) has moved from its original position at the end of the line. A tool many translators use to get around this word order problem is to introduce a subject 'I' (so the first line would read as something like 'In springtime *I slumber*, unaware of daybreak'). I have tried to avoid this work-around, because it provides a layer of extra information to the reader that is not present in the original.
