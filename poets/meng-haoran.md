During the Song dynasty (960 - 1279) it was fashionable to think of Meng Haoran 孟浩然 (689 - 740) and [Wang Wei](/poets/wang-wei.html) 王維 (699 - 759) as belonging to the same school of poetry. They both wrote naturalistic poems conveyed with clarity and simplicity. These two poets were seen as second only to the unsurpassed excellence of Li Bai 李白 (701 - 762) and Du Fu 杜甫 (712 – 770), who together are known as the four great poets of the Tang dynasty.
