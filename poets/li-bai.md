Li Bai 李白 (701 - 762) was one of the most prominent Tang dynasty poets. In his early years, participation in literature and the arts was encouraged by the emperor. However, his life ended in chaos amid the An Lushan 安祿山 rebellion. Li Bai is known for his use of vivid, clear imagery interspersed with reflections on nature, solitude, and wine drinking.
