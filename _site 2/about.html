<p>This website is intended as a call-back to how I remember the internet of the nineties. It was a place where hobbyists would publish pages related to their interests in a world that was more simple and straightforward than it is now. It was full of websites built with care and attention that no-one visited. And it didn’t matter so much.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>While I don’t profess to being an expert or having any academic expertise of note, I’ve long been interested in classical Chinese literature. I enjoy the process of translation: uncovering and interpreting multiple layers of meaning.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When I find a piece of poetry or prose to translate, I’ll post my translations on this site. As the old saying goes, <em>pao zhuan yin yu</em> 拋磚引玉, may the bricks that I have cast attract jade.</p>
