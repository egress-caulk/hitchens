### Translation notes

This poem is probably one of the most frequently translated Chinese poems. It was even painted by the great Japanese artist Hokusai, in his series [A True Mirror of the Imagery of Chinese and Japanese Poets](https://allenartcollection.oberlin.edu/objects/10887/the-chinese-poet-li-bai-viewing-a-waterfall-from-the-series). However, the scene was already recognisable to the Japanese literati in the early sixteenth century, when it was pained by [Soma](https://searchcollection.asianart.org/objects/7734/li-bai-viewing-the-waterfall-at-mt-lu).
  
It’s such a famous poem, that perhaps even the translation notes are well known. On the first line, we have *sheng ziyan* 生紫煙 which literally means ‘to cause purple smoke to be born/exist’. Burton Watson, one of the best and most famous translators of Chinese poetry into English, has ‘kindles violet smoke’ here. I prefer ‘raising’ because generally after something is born, it rises or is raised.

In the second line *gua* 掛 can mean to hang, to suspend, or to droop down. I like suspend because it better conveys the idea that this wall of water can appear as if it is static, which is then further explored in the following line.

I translated the third line quite literally. I played with the idea of ‘flying with the current’ but ultimately I think the stream of words I ended up with does enough to convey the power of what Li Bai is trying to convey.

We already know Li Bai has a [vivid imagination](/poets/li-bai-李白/ballad-on-leaving-a-voyage-of-tianmu-mountain-in-a-dream). The question is, what is he imagining in the final line? *Yinhe* 銀河 in Modern Chinese means the Milky Way, but is literally comprised of two characters that translate to ‘silver river’. Li Bai would not have known the concept of the Milky Way, but would have recognised the river of stars appearing to fall in the dark night sky that we now call the Milky Way. In his mind, they fall from a place that he calls ninth heaven (*jiutian* 九天). This is the outer edge of heaven, reserved for the grandest spirits and deities. It is also the furthest point in the deep sky that can possibly be imagined. I went with ‘celestial heights’ here to give a sense of the metaphysical and the literal. Meanwhile, Watson preferred ‘the ninth height of heaven’.
