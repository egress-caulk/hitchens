> Seeing in New Year at my younger cousin’s home <br>
> Bowls of peppered ale hold blessed blossoms <br>
> High officials make noise among stabled horses <br>
> Lines of torches disperse crows in the woods <br>
> Tomorrow, my fourtieth year will pass <br>
> Rising upward in slanted evening light <br>
> Who can continue to be this constrained? <br>
> Dead drunkenness to the end of my days  <br><br><br>

### Translation notes

This poem contains phrases that required deep research, because my go-to medieval Chinese dictionary didn’t contain the vocabulary. In the first line, *a rong* 阿戎 refers to Du Wei, a younger relative of Du Fu who is referenced in the title of the poem. *A rong* is thought to be a phrase used at the time to refer to younger relatives.

In the next line, peppered aleis implied by *jiao* ‌椒 which means pepper, though making ale infused with pepper flowers was a New Year’s custom in Sichuan, where this poem is set.

On the third line, the phrase ‘high officials’ is nowhere to be seen in the original text. The original poem has *he zan* 盍簪, which translates roughly to hairpins. It took a visit to [Taiwan’s National Academy of Educational Research](https://dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/dictView.jsp?ID=79872&la=0&powerMode=0) to verify the use of *he* 盍 in this phrase, which dates back to the Book of Changes - first encountered in Xie Lingyun’s [journey into the mountains](/poets/xie-lingyun-謝靈運/heading-to-north-mountain). 

[Apparently](https://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/rpr/index.php/object-biography-index/19-prmcollection/290-chinese-hairpins/index.html), hairpins have been important ornaments throughout Chinese history, and by the time of Tang dynasty China, they functioned almost like crowns to indicate rank and seniority. Here, then, we can infer that Du Fu’s cousin is of extremely high standing in society, with high officials riding to pay tribute to him on New Year’s Eve. This idea is continued in the following line, where the torches represent the attendants of these high officials, while also conveying the majesty of the event. (Records show that Du Wei 杜位 was Du Fu’s second cousin and married into a noble family.)

The scene having been set, the final lines of the poem speak for themselves. For the first time in these translations, we see a poet turn to alcohol to drown their sorrows! Drinking is a common theme in Chinese poetry, particularly among the more reclusive types, and symbolises a poet's response to the social and political circumstances of their times or their personal sorrows.
