    <p>This poem by Meng Haoran takes place after a sleepless night, and may have once been the most famous poem in China<!--more-->. It was one of the first poems that generations of educated Chinese children would memorise owing to its place on the first page of the anthology <em>Qianjia Shi</em> 千家詩 (A Thousand Family Poems). Evidenced by many of his other poems, Meng Haoran liked to drink. Rather than reading this as a children’s poem, I like to imagine him with a hangover.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>春眠不覺曉，<br />
處處聞啼鳥。<br />
夜來風雨聲，<br />
花落知多少。<br /> <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Spring Dawn</strong>
<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Springtime, half-asleep, unaware of daybreak, <br />
All around I hear birdsong. <br />
Night brought noise, wind and rain, <br />
Blossoms fell, who knows how many? <br /><br /></p>

<h5 id="translation-notes">Translation notes</h5>

<p>Although the characters are quite easy to understand in this poem, a translation isn’t quite so straightforward.  It’s a challenge to translate each character in an order that is faithful to the original. Imagining the poet half-awake and articulating one thought after another helped me retain as much of the original structure as possible. I have attempted to create this effect by adding in punctuation to ensure that, similar to Chinese characters, each thought is self-contained. The only major deviation from the original word order is <em>sheng</em> 聲 (‘noise’), which has moved from its original position at the end of the third line.</p>

<p>A tool many translators use to get around this word order problem is to introduce a subject to most lines such as ‘I’ (for example, the first line would read as something like ‘In springtime <em>I am half-asleep</em>, unaware of daybreak’). I have tried to avoid this work-around, because it provides the reader with extra assumptions, or noise, not present in the original.</p>
